# Variables and Data Types 📦

## What are Variables?

Variables are like containers that store data. Think of them as labeled boxes where you can keep different types of information.

## Basic Data Types in Python

### 1. **Integers (int)**
Whole numbers without decimal points
```python
age = 25
year = 2024
```

### 2. **Float**
Numbers with decimal points
```python
price = 19.99
temperature = 36.5
```

### 3. **String (str)**
Text data enclosed in quotes
```python
name = "Alice"
message = 'Hello World'
```

### 4. **Boolean (bool)**
True or False values
```python
is_student = True
has_passed = False
```

### 5. **List**
Ordered collection of items (mutable)
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### 6. **Tuple**
Ordered collection of items (immutable)
```python
coordinates = (10, 20)
rgb_color = (255, 0, 0)
```

### 7. **Dictionary**
Key-value pairs
```python
student = {"name": "John", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}
```

## Tips for Beginners

- Variable names should be descriptive (e.g., `student_name` instead of `x`)
- Use lowercase with underscores for variable names (snake_case)
- Variables cannot start with numbers
- Python is case-sensitive (`Name` and `name` are different)

## Practice

Try running each example file and modify the values to see different results!
