# Practice Problems 💪

## About This Section

This folder contains practice problems to help you apply what you've learned. Each problem has a solution file, but try solving them on your own first!

## How to Use

1. **Read the problem** in the problem file
2. **Try to solve it yourself** - This is important!
3. **Test your solution** with different inputs
4. **Check the solution file** only after attempting
5. **Compare approaches** - There might be multiple ways to solve!

## Problem Categories

### Basic Problems
- Simple calculations
- String manipulations
- List operations

### Intermediate Problems
- Using loops and conditions together
- Working with functions
- Processing multiple inputs

### Challenge Problems
- Combining multiple concepts
- Algorithm implementation
- Real-world scenarios

## Problems List

1. **01_number_problems.py** - Number manipulation and calculations
2. **02_string_problems.py** - String operations and formatting
3. **03_list_problems.py** - List operations and algorithms
4. **04_function_problems.py** - Creating and using functions
5. **05_mixed_problems.py** - Problems combining multiple concepts

## Tips for Problem Solving

1. **Understand the problem** - Read carefully
2. **Plan your approach** - Think before coding
3. **Start simple** - Get basic solution working first
4. **Test with examples** - Try different inputs
5. **Optimize later** - Make it work, then make it better

## Solutions

Solutions are provided in the same files after the problem statement. Try to solve problems before looking at solutions!

## Keep Practicing!

- Try modifying the problems
- Create your own variations
- Challenge yourself with edge cases
- Time yourself and try to improve

Remember: **Practice makes perfect!** 🚀
